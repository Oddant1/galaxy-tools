# QIIME 2 Galaxy Tools
**WIP: not ready for use yet**


## How to update the tools
All tools are automatically generated by [q2galaxy](https://github.com/qiime2/q2galaxy) within a conda environment.
These `*.xml` and `.shed.yml` files should not be manually modified.

The state of this repo is controlled by `distros.yaml` in the root.
To add or update tools, modify this file in the root and issue a PR.
This PR will be tested to confirm the changes will render a new repo state.
Once merged, Github Actions will issue a new PR with all tools re-rendered.

To run this manually, you can use the `Makefile` provided in the root as well.
